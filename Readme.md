# Research Networking Platform

## Overview

Researchers working on related topics often remain unaware of potential collaboration opportunities within their own institutions. This leads to duplicated efforts, missed interdisciplinary partnerships, and slower innovation.

The **Research Networking Platform** is designed to bridge this gap by connecting researchers, faculty members, scholars, and students based on their research interests, publications, expertise, and ongoing projects. The platform helps users discover potential collaborators, explore research activities across departments, and encourage interdisciplinary innovation.

## Problem Statement

In many universities and research institutions, researchers operate within departmental silos. As a result:

- Researchers are unaware of similar work happening in other departments.
- Collaboration opportunities are often missed.
- Interdisciplinary research projects are difficult to initiate.
- Research resources and expertise remain underutilized.
- Duplicate research efforts may occur due to lack of visibility.

A centralized platform is needed to improve research discoverability and collaboration.

---

## Proposed Solution

The Research Networking Platform provides a centralized environment where researchers can:

- Create and manage professional research profiles.
- Showcase research interests, publications, and projects.
- Discover researchers with similar or complementary expertise.
- Search research topics across departments.
- Receive collaboration recommendations.
- Connect and communicate with potential collaborators.

By making institutional research more visible and accessible, the platform promotes innovation and knowledge sharing.

## Objectives

- Increase awareness of ongoing research within institutions.
- Promote interdisciplinary collaboration.
- Reduce duplication of research efforts.
- Facilitate networking among researchers.
- Provide intelligent recommendations for potential partnerships.
- Improve accessibility to research information.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React.js
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js

### Database
- PostgreSQL / MongoDB

### Authentication
- JWT Authentication
- Role-Based Access Control

### Additional Tools
- Git & GitHub
- REST APIs

## Backend setup

1. Install dependencies in `backend` with `npm install`.
2. Create `backend/.env` and set `MONGO_URI` to a MongoDB Atlas connection string.
3. Start the API with `npm start` or `npm run dev`.

The backend models users, research projects, and collaboration requests. References connect project owners and collaborators, while each collaboration request stores its sender, recipient, optional project, message, and status.

---

## System Workflow

1. User registers and creates a research profile.
2. Research interests and expertise are added.
3. Research data is stored in the database.
4. Users search for researchers or projects.
5. Recommendation engine identifies potential collaborators.
6. Users connect and initiate collaborations.
7. Research outcomes and projects are shared on the platform.

---

## Expected Outcomes

- Increased interdisciplinary research collaborations.
- Better visibility of institutional research activities.
- Improved knowledge sharing among researchers.
- Enhanced innovation through cross-domain partnerships.
- Stronger research ecosystem within institutions.

---

## Future Enhancements

- AI-powered collaboration recommendations.
- Integration with Google Scholar and ORCID.
- Publication citation analysis.
- Research funding opportunity recommendations.
- Real-time messaging and discussion forums.
- Research event and conference tracking.
